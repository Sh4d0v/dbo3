<hr />
DragonBlaze Online (3) is an MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) based on the discontinued DBO2 project, which means that it allows multiple players to play simultaneously, connected to a virtual world. Players use the game client application to connect to the server. Taking on the role of a powerful warrior, they travel the world, cooperating or fighting with other players connected to the game. The whole game is set in a colorful, two-dimensional world modeled on Akira Toriyama's manga.
